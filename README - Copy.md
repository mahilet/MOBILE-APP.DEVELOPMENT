# MOBILE-APP.DEVELOPMENT-HW1
Building My First App

On my first week in android class, I download and install Android Studio
then I created a new Android project with Android Studio and run a debug
that I built AD340/Hw1, and tested the application on Nexus 5x. Still,
I'm having a problem with emulator
